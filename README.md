# MAE120s_Spaceflight-Mechanics

This is a collection of routines (mostly in MATLAB) used in teachings for eCornell's Spaceflight Mechanics program.

MATLAB code was all written/tested in various versions up to R2018b, but should (mostly) work in any version after R2014b.  Some plot commands may not work in earlier releases. MATLAB live scripts (in the Notebooks directory) may not work properly in any version older than 2018a.
